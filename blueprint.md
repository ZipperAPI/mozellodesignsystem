# Project Blueprint

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the development plan and serves as a single source of truth for the "netpasaule" project. The project is a modern, responsive landing page designed to be visually appealing, interactive, and easy to maintain.

## 2. Technology Stack

-   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS v4** (Runtime JIT compiler). The `<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4'/></script>` will be included in the HTML for in-browser Just-in-Time compilation.
-   **Interactivity**: **ReefJS** (`https://reef.gomakethings.com/`). A lightweight library for creating reactive, state-based UI components.
-   **Design System**: **Masco Tailwind Theme**. The visual design will be based on this theme, adapted to fit the project's brand identity.

## 3. Project Structure

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the page structure.
-   `main.js`: The primary JavaScript file for ReefJS components and other custom logic.
-   `blueprint.md`: This file.

## 4. Style, Design, and Feature Outline

This section will be updated iteratively as new features and styles are implemented.

### Initial Implementation:

-   **Layout**: A responsive layout using Tailwind CSS classes for the header, hero section, feature sections, and footer.
-   **Header**:
    -   Logo: "netpasaule" with a globe icon.
    -   Navigation: Links for Home, Features, Pricing, and About.
    -   Action Buttons: "Login" and "Sign Up".
-   **Hero Section**:
    -   A prominent headline and subheadline.
    -   A primary call-to-action button.
-   **Interactivity**:
    -   Initial state management for any dynamic components (e.g., a theme toggle, interactive form) will be handled by ReefJS.

## 5. Plan for Current Request

*This section will be updated with each new user request to outline the specific steps for implementation.*

**Current Task:** Improve the project blueprint.

1.  **Analyze Request**: The user wants to improve the existing `blueprint.md` file.
2.  **Consult Guidelines**: Reference the `GEMINI.md` file for best practices on structuring a blueprint.
3.  **Rewrite Blueprint**:
    -   Create a more detailed and structured document with clear sections for Overview, Technology Stack, Project Structure, and a detailed Design/Feature Outline.
    -   Incorporate the user-specified technologies (Tailwind v4, ReefJS, Masco theme) into the Technology Stack section.
    -   Establish a placeholder for documenting features as they are built.
    -   Add this "Plan for Current Request" section to demonstrate the intended workflow for future tasks.
4.  **Confirm**: Present the new, improved blueprint to the user.
